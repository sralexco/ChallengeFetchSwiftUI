### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
ImageCacheManager – Managing image caching was a primary priority to ensure efficient saving and storage of images in cache.
SwiftUI View Creation – Focused on well structured and properly defined views.
RecipesViewModel – Responsible for handling data requests and ensuring good communication between the model and the view.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Total time spent - 2 days (4 hours)
I structured my workflow using a Kanban board to enhance productivity and track progress effectively.

Task Breakdown:
_BaseViewModel - 1h
_Views - 4h
_ViewModel - 3h
_ImageCacheManger - 3h
_CacheImageRecipe - 1h
_CoreComponents Testing - 1h
_Recipes Testing- 4h
_Util Testing - 2h
_Upload to github - 1h

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Implementing the ImageCacheManager required a key class to manage image caching efficiently.
Testing was demanding time, especially in covering all possible scenarios. However, it´s important for ensuring code security and reliability.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The SwiftUI view testing was a challenge. I initially planned to use ViewInspector for the testing of views to the project, but its wasn´t posible for the 
restrictions about external libraries.
